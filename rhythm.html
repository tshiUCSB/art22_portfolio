        <h2> Ryhthm </h2>
        <p> A web-based rhythm game with note-mapping and produces a graphic visualization of player performance after finishing the song. 
Instead of visualizing just the sounds in a song, <span class= "crimson">Ryhthm</span> intends to include audience interaction as part of the visualization. With a graphic generated for each player with each playthrough, there is something more that remains after interacting with the song to share with others other than a numerical score and the individual experience that the player walks away with. <br><br>
Press <span class= "crimson">A, W, D, F, H, J, K, or L</span> on the keyboard in correspondence with the section that the note is located in when the note reaches the edge of the circle to hit the note. <br><br></p>
